Infinitely Scrolling Message List
---------------------------------------------
Build a prototype that shows a potentially very long list of messages. 
The platform is web but users should be able to scroll through messages smoothly 
on a mobile device. Messages can be loaded via the API specified below. 

Requirements:
●	The header should be fixed with messages that scroll underneath.
●	Users should be able to swipe a message horizontally offscreen to dismiss it.
●	Messages should load automatically so that a user scrolling slowly should 
    never see the bottom of the list.
●	The prototype should work well even after many messages have been loaded.

API
-----------------------------------------------------
- Request
    ●  GET http://message-list.appspot.com/messages

    Optional Parameters
    ●	limit: Specifies the number of results to fetch, up to 100.
    ●	pageToken: A token provided by the previous response to fetch the next page.

- Response
    ●  JSON structure of the form:

        {
            'count': number of messages,
            'messages': {
                'id': integer message ID,
                'author': {
                    'name': name of the message author,
                    'photoUrl': photo of the message author,
                },
                'updated': UTC timestamp of the messages creation time,
                'content': message content,
            },
            'pageToken': a continuation token for the next page of messages
        }

- To get the next page, use the continuation token:
    ●  GET /messages?pageToken=page token provided by the previous response
